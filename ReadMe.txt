Current TODOs/issues (not necessarily in order of importance)

> Need tree width of graphs

> Find some non-planar graphs

> Compare to specific GC algorithm & greedy

> Test on another problem (note: for 3-sat, will we need clique potentials...?)
   
> Because the factors never really seem to decrease for MN and aren't re-normalized, they just keep getting
   bigger. This might not be an issue, but we should consider finding some way to mitigate this just
   in case.
   
> Find a way to scale back factor potential values (maybe /10 every so many iterations?)
   
> Change some of the bad variable names (i.e. potential wrt the tempVal read in, or s for scanner). Got IntegerParticle
  and IntegerParticle done.   
  
> Implement another evolutionary alternative (e.g. MOA)

> (Maybe) find a non-evolutionary alternative to test against
